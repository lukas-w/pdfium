Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

Currently we are intentionally not building the following files from
HarfBuzz. Specifically, we are not building hb-coretext any longer, as we rely
on HarfBuzz' built-in AAT shaping.

    dump-khmer-data.cc
